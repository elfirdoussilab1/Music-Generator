# Music-Generator
In this repository, we implement an algorithm for generating music notes using Recurrent Neural Networks. The music is encoded using the ABC notation, hence our model predicts the notes with this notation and then these latter are converted to wavefrom files.

To run these notebooks correclty, you should copy this code and paste it in the Google Colab notebook used connected to the course's Github, which we can access with the following link: [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aamini/introtodeeplearning/blob/2023/lab1/Part2_Music_Generation.ipynb)


To be able to test these algorithms by yourself, you should install the [MIT Deep Learning](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/) library, which can be easily done using the command:

```sh
pip install mitdeeplearning
