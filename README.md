# Music-Generator
In this repository, we implement an algorithm for generating music notes using Recurrent Neural Networks. The music is encoded using the ABC notation, hence our model predicts the notes with this notation and then these latter are converted to wavefrom files.


To be able to test these algorithms by yourself, you should install the [MIT Deep Learning](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/) library, which can be easily done using the following command:

```sh
pip install mitdeeplearning
```
Here are some tracks that have been generated by the RNN:

[Track-1](./music_generated/track-1.wav)

[Track-2](./music_generated/track-2.wav)

[Track-3](./music_generated/track-3.wav)

[Track-4](./music_generated/track-4.wav)

Enjoy !
